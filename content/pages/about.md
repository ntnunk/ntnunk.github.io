title: About Me
slug: about

I'm a chaotically-focused (see what I did there?) self-professed geek and technologist. I work in
technology as well as having software, electronics, and general gadgetry as a life-long hobby. I
started tinkering with electronics as a sophmore in high school, went on to work in an advanced
electronics field for [the US Navy](http://www.navy.mil), and have been working with software and
electronics ever since. I'm particularly interested in that space where software and hardware meet,
so things like [Arduino](http://www.arduino.cc) and [Raspberry Pi](http://www.raspberrypi.org) are
things I love.

My other major passion these days is cycling and bicycle racing. I started cycling in my early 40s
as a way to lose weight and try to counteract all the time I spend sitting in front of computers and
it quickly became an addition. I still remember my first eight mile road ride and how hard that was.
These days I'm spending far too many hours every week training so I can compete in road races, time
trials, criteriums, and cyclocross.

As if all that wasn't enough, I'm a life-long guitarist with an interest in digital recording. I
don't play as much as I'd like anymore but it's still something I love and I play when and as I can.
I also like to work on recording projects with my Open Source, Linux-based recording studio using
[Ardour](http://www.ardour.org) and all the associated tools that go with it.

When I'm not engaged in one of my many time-consuming hobbies, I can usually be found reading,
watching [Carolina Hurricanes](http://www.hurricanes.com) hockey, or playing with power tools of
some sort. Oh, and sometimes I actually sleep.
