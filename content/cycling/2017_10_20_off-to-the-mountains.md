I'm still struggling for some consistency in the cycling and training. Things have gotten a little
bit better but I'm still in general riding only an hour or so every other day. I'm gonna shake
things up this weekend though, as a couple of friends and I are about to leave for [Nantahala
National Forest](https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/nfsnc/recarea/?recid=48634) for a long weekend of
riding mountain bikes at [Tsali](https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/nfsnc/recarea/?recid=48922). I'm
really looking forward to it! It's been a long few weeks of work, fun though it is, and life. I'm
ready for a break and planning on getting back to riding more consistently, watching the diet,
hitting the gym, and beginning prep for 2018 when I get back.
